## How to use Google Clone

**Important!** You need a Linux shell that support Git to download it. I recommend [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git Bash").

It's very simple, you have to:

- Choose a location in your PC to download the project. For example, Desktop.

- Right clic > Git Bash Here

If you use HTTP (default):

- Run `git clone https://github.com/edmanrique/google-clone.git`

**Important!** You can't use SSH if you don't configure it previously. So, it's easier but more insecure use HTTP. You can't search tutorials to configure it in Google and YouTube depending of your OS (Operative System).

else, if you use SSH (recommended):

- Run `git clone git@github.com:edmanrique/google-clone.git`

**Important!** You have to open index.html with a browser, for example: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, Microsoft Edge, and so on. You can choose how to open a file with right click on file > open with > choose a browser.

- Open google-clone folder > index.html

And... Enjoy Google Clone!
